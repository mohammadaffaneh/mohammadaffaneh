## Hey, I'm Mohammad

I build production data and AI systems and user-facing applications. Currently working on agentic systems, workflows, search/retrieval pipelines, and AI-powered automation tools at Takeda.

**EExpertise and interests:**
- Agentic systems with orchestration patterns for complex workflows‚Äîrouting between specialized agents, retrieval augmentation, multimodal, tool use, and memory management
- Batch inference pipelines for multimodal document understanding. Extracting information and structured data from visual and textual content at scale
- Scalable search infrastructure combining semantic and lexical retrieval
- Production FastAPI services handling high-concurrency LLM operations with async patterns
- Automation of scalable unstructured documents generation pipelines processing 

**Stack:** Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Claude Agent SDK, AWS (Bedrock, EKS, SageMaker, S3, Step Functions, DynamoDB), Databricks, OpenSearch, Redis

### How I Work

Ship iteratively with production mindset from day one‚Äîtests, CI/CD, monitoring, docs. Lead technical decisions by working closely with product, backend, data, and QA teams. Run discovery sessions, guide PoCs, and enable platform teams to extend what I build. Pragmatic about trade-offs; comfortable with ambiguity.

## Differentiators

**Evaluation-First Development**: Every AI feature ships with quantitative evals and regression tests‚Äîno "vibes-based" deployments  
**Cost-Aware Architecture**: Design for $/request, not just accuracy; implement caching, prompt compression, model routing

##  Let's Connect

Building something that needs to go from POC to production without the usual AI deployment failures? Let's talk architecture trade-offs.
