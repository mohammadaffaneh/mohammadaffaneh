## AI Engineer | Building Production-Grade Data & AI Systems

I build and ship Data & AI applications for enterprise workflows‚Äîfocusing on agentic systems, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated workflows. Currently working at Takeda, delivering AI features for manufacturing and quality systems that teams actually use.

### What I Built

**Agentic RAG Systems**  
Agents with hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector), document grading, and streaming responses.

**Production APIs & Infrastructure**  
- FastAPI services with clean architecture, async I/O, LLM with structured output, and strong typing. 
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, multi-stage Docker builds, K8s deployments (EKS), and SonarCloud gates. 
- Design for observability and safe extensibility.

**Search & Data Pipelines**  
Databricks and AWS SageMaker Workflows for indexing, chunking, embeddings, and evaluation tracking. OpenSearch (hybrid search), DynamoDB (multi-table with GSIs), Redis for context/memory.

**AI-Assisted Workflows**  
Automated generation of 800+ annual regulatory reports, event summarization (55% faster time-to-insight), deviation drafting assistants, and GMP-validated multivariate monitoring (30-day earlier drift detection).

### Tech Stack

**Core:** Python, FastAPI, SQL  
**AI/ML:** LangGraph, LangChain, Google ADK, Claude Agents SDK, Hugging Face, prompt/context engineering, RAG, NLP evals  
**Search & Data:** OpenSearch, DynamoDB, Redis, PySpark  
**Orchestration:** Databricks (workflows, model serving, MLflow), SageMaker, Celery  
**DevOps:** GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), JFrog  
**Cloud:** AWS, Azure, Databricks  

### Current Focus

Scaling agentic workflows with better evaluation frameworks, optimizing RAG retrieval quality vs. cost trade-offs, and building reusable service templates for rapid AI feature delivery. Experimenting with advanced agent patterns (planning, sub-agents, routing, reflection, tool use) and production LLM observability.

### How I Work

Ship iteratively with production mindset from day one‚Äîtests, CI/CD, monitoring, docs. Lead technical decisions by working closely with product, backend, data, and QA teams. Run discovery sessions, guide PoCs, and enable platform teams to extend what I build. Pragmatic about trade-offs; comfortable with ambiguity.

## Differentiators

**Evaluation-First Development**: Every AI feature ships with quantitative evals and regression tests‚Äîno "vibes-based" deployments  
**Cost-Aware Architecture**: Design for $/request, not just accuracy; implement caching, prompt compression, model routing

##  Let's Connect

Building something that needs to go from POC to production without the usual AI deployment failures? Let's talk architecture trade-offs.
