Building agentic AI systems and data pipelines.

**Agent Systems & Orchestration**
- Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph/ Claude Agents SDK for complex workflows—routing between specialized agents, and managing context across agent interactions
- Self-healing agent pipelines with automated error recovery, retry logic, and fallback strategies
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows
- Monitoring and alerting for LLM operations with latency, cost, and error rate tracking

**Scalable AI Infrastructure**
- Batch inference pipelines for multimodal document understanding at scale
- Hybrid search systems combining semantic and lexical retrieval with OpenSearch
- Production FastAPI services with async patterns for high-concurrency LLM operations

**Stack:** Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Claude/OpenAI Agents SDK, AWS, OpenSearch, Redis

## Differentiators

**Reliability Engineering for AI**: Design agent systems with self-healing capabilities, automated recovery workflows, and observability

**Evaluation-Driven Development**: Every AI feature ships with quantitative evals, regression tests, and continuous monitoring—deployed systems improve over time through structured feedback
